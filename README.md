Specification
Design and implement a program, initials, that, given a person’s name, prints a person’s initials.

Implement your program in a file called initials.c in a directory called initials.

Your program should prompt a user for their name using get_string to obtain their name as a string.

You may assume that the user’s input will contain only letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) plus single spaces between words. You don’t need to worry about names like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Conan O’Brien, or David J. Malan!

Your program should print the user’s initials (i.e., the first letter of each word in their name) with no spaces or periods, followed by a newline (\n).
